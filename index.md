## Welcome to Random Corp

Random Corp is making android apps that exapand possiblities.

Our lives are built around our decisions, some of these decision are based off of intuition, some on priorities, some on randomness. While it is okay to rely on intution, or feeling, we are humans, and humans are bias towards patterns and familiarity. Decision based on intution will in the long run be similar. Decisions based on priority is an must for achieving ones goals. It helps to choose what is most impartant. However, this also tends to narrow the options as by definition only a few things can be most impartant. The possiblities allowed by the first two categories are only a small set of all possibilities. The other possiblities are those that we don't usally choose. This is the value of randomess. And Random Corp's various apps builds on randomness unlock new paths of exploration they never knew existed.
